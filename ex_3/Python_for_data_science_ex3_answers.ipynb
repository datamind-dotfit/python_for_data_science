    "Welcome to Python for Data Science! Today we'll deep dive into the world of Pandas, dataframes and dataframe operations. You may copy this notebook to your local Google Drive or computer to study the questions and answers later on. If you're not familiar with notebooks, please see https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebook.html#notebook-documents for a quick introduction to Jupyter notebooks. These principles are directly applicable to Google Colabs notebooks.\n",

    "**Some tips to get you started:**\n",
    "- Make new cells! You can make as many as you want, this way you can execute small code blocks and work iteratively.\n",
    "- Break larger problems down into small chunks (and work them out in individual code cells). Once you're convinced everything is in order, you can merge your code into one code cell.\n",
    "- Use comments to explain what you're doing, `#` allows you to write inline comments.\n",
    "- If you resort to Google or Stackoverflow for help, make sure you actually understand the solution that is provided. And rather than copying the code, make sure <u>*you*</u> write the code!\n"

    "### Pandas filtering, a look under the hood\n",
    "In this section you will practice filtering data in Pandas. Filtering in Pandas may look a bit daunting, but it's actually quite easy. Filtering is always done by following the same pattern and to understand how Pandas filtering works under the hood, we will first investigate the result of a filter/expression. After that you'll practice by applying these filters on the sales and observations data.\n",

    "Filtering is done by writing expressions that evaluate to `True` or `False`. There may be more than one expression, we can connect multiple expression by constructions such as AND and OR, you may have seen this before in mathematics or a course on logic. These expressions are often captured in a *truth table*. In pandas AND is indicated by `&` and or by `|`. \n",
